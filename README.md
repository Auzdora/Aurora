# Personal-GPT
**Personal-GPT** is an open source project which can connects to your own local knowledge database and multiple plugins with LLM. You can try to unleash the potential power of function calling and your personal data. Its an experiment project that try to combine both LLM capability and function calling. Feel free to change and reuse the code!


**Personal-GPT** is built by ü¶úÔ∏èüîó [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) framework, you can learn some basic concepts in their [docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html).


In current version, I'm building it towards to a command line tools. Maybe add a web or app interface in the future.
